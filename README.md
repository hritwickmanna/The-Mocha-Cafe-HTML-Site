# ☕ The Mocha Café – HTML Website Project

## 📖 Overview

The Mocha Café is a simple three-page restaurant website built entirely using HTML.

This project demonstrates the use of semantic HTML structure, accessibility features, and best practices for building a basic yet well-organized website — without using CSS or JavaScript. It was created as part of an HTML learning project to strengthen understanding of web page structure and navigation.

## 🧱 HTML Concepts Used

* **Semantic HTML elements**: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, `<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>`, `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, etc.
* **Accessibility practices**:
    * Proper `alt` attributes for images.
    * Associated `<label>` elements for all form fields.
    * Internal linking for smooth navigation between pages.
    * Proper use of `meta` tags for author, description, and encoding.
    * `<blockquote>`, `<strong>`, and `<time>` for improved semantic meaning.
    * Use of `<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>` anchors for navigation.

## 🧭 Navigation Flow

Each page includes a navigation menu linking to:

* **Home**: `/project/index.html`
* **Timings**: `/project/timings.html`
* **Contact Us**: `/project/contact.html`

All links are internal and functional.
